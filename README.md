# Australia Rain Prediction
*Australia's weather and climate can vary greatly depending on the region. In general, the country experiences a dry season and a wet season. The wet season, also known as the monsoon season, typically occurs between December and March in the northern regions of Australia, while the southern regions tend to have the bulk of their rainfall between June and September. However, forecasting the exact timing and amount of rainfall can be difficult due to the complex nature of weather systems. The Bureau of Meteorology in Australia provides regular updates and forecasts on rainfall and other weather conditions.*
